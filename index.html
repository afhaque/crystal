      <!-- SUGGESTION #1 - Generally, you include your own custom css AFTER the bootstrap css. This is because you will use your custom css to override any Bootstrap pre-built things. In you case, when I do this, it throws things off. So I'm keeping it as is, but just keep this in mind for the future. -->

  <!-- CHANGE #1 - Generally, you have everything in bootstrap be wrapped up inside of a container. This is so Bootstrap adds a nice border around everything. This also makes it so the rows and columns works right.-->
  <!-- Alternatively you can use <div class="container-fluid"> if you want to have it span the entire width of the page.  -->

  <!-- CHANGE #2 - Your issue with the gems not getting clicked was happening because your divs are overlapping. This sometimes happens when one div is opened but not closed where you think it is. Using comments and indenting cleanly helps proactively avoid these kinds of things. (In this case this wasn't your issue)-->

          <div class="panel-body">Below, you will see four crystals, a random number to which you will match, and your point box.  In order to win the game, you must click the crystals in a way in which causes your total points, to match the random number given to you at the start of each round.  The values behind each crystal differ from one another, and can only be discovered through clicking each crystal.  The trick is, after you win (or lose) a game, the values behind each crystal change, as well as the points you are trying to match.  If your total points yields a number as small as one point higher than the given number, you will lose. Get those calculators ready, and good luck!</div>
